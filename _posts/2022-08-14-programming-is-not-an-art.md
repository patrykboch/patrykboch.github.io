Before the COVID plague and war near the Polish border, I enjoyed attending tech-dev conferences (now most of them are canceled). I recall one of them, particularly the situation in which a speaker asks an auditory _do you consider yourself to be an artist while writing code?_ I was shocked when I saw how many of the programmers gathered raise a hand. 

Calling programming an art form and a programmer an artist is a big mistake IMO and drives me nuts TBH. Programming is a craft, always, and has nothing in common with an art, even if a creative frontend dev is thought.

I was 13 when I made my first webpage, I used a lot of built-in tools in a code editor, added some dynamic features with flash (which is now a history) as well as other design components that came from various software. I feel it was closer to an art then instead of every-day code crafting with taking design patterns and principles into account. Again, calling a programmer an artist it's just like a code smell.
